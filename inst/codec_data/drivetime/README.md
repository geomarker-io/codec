A census tract-level measure of drive time to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is derived using 6-minute interval drive time isochrones obtained from [openroute service](https://classic-maps.openrouteservice.org/reach?n1=38.393339&n2=-95.339355&n3=5&b=0&i=0&j1=30&j2=15&k1=en-US&k2=km).
Each tract-level drive time is an area-weighted average of drive times.
