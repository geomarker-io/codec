  ## About

  Census tract-level measures of parcel characteristics for all residential parcles in Hamilton County, Ohio.
  Tract-level measures are derived from the data packages stored in the [`parcel`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/parcel) repository.
  Version 0.1.0 of the `parcel` CoDEC data resource harmonizes [`cagis_parcels-v1.1.1`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/parcel/releases/tag/cagis_parcels-v1.1.1) and [`auditor_online_parcels-v0.2.1`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/parcel/releases/tag/auditor_online_parcels-v0.2.1).

  - condominiums: `condominium unit`, `condo or pud garage`
  - single family homes: `single family dwelling`
