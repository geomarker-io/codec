  ## About

  Census tract-level measures of crime incidents (including property crimes, violent crimes, other crimes, gunshots, and reported shootings) in Hamilton County, Ohio.

  Tract-level measures are derived from the data packages stored in the [`xx_address` repository](https://github.com/geomarker-io/xx_address), including [`crime_incidents-v0.1.2`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/xx_address/releases/tag/crime_incidents-v0.1.2), [`shotspotter-v0.1.2`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/xx_address/releases/tag/shotspotter-v0.1.2), and [`reported_shootings-v0.1.0`](https://github.com/geomarker-io/xx_address/releases/tag/reported_shootings-v0.1.0). View the metadata for each of these data packages for more information about their sources.

  ## Data

  Jittered (within the same block) latitude and longitude corresponding to the location of each reported crime are available from each data source.
  Crimes are aggregated to the tract level by summing the number of crimes for each tract.
  For higher resolution crime data, see the [`xx_address` repository](https://github.com/geomarker-io/xx_address).

  Because of how the data is available, values will be missing (`NA`) if either (1) there were zero instances in a tract-year-month _or_ (2) it is outside the spatial or temporal extent for the respective data source.
  In some cases, it may be appropriate to impute zero instances in place of missing counts; for example, if it is clear that the tract was measured the month before and after in the same year.
  More specifically:

  - `crime_incidents` and `reported_shootings` are geographically limited to the City of Cincinnati
  - `shotspotter` is limited to specific time periods for different target neighborhoods
