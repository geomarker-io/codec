  ## About

  Select population, socioeconomic, and housing measures derived from the U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS) are generally available from 2013 through 2022 and were selected to cover three domains:

  - **Population**: number of kids, number of households (with kids), single-parent households, racial and ethnic composition, limited English speaking households
  - **Socioeconomic**: education, income, poverty, employment, health insurance, public income assistance
  - **Housing**: vacancy, age, value, tenure, rent to income ratio

  ## Data

  ### Types of ACS measures

  Measures and their definitions are contained in `hh_acs_measures.R`.
  Generally, each of the derived ACS measures are expressed in one of three ways:

  1. measures starting with **`n_`** represent a **number** of something, such as `n_household`

  2. measures starting with **`prop_`** represent a **proportion** of some total, such as `prop_poverty`

  3. measures starting with **`median_`** represent a **median** of a number in a population, such as `median_income`

  ### Missing Data

  Some data are unavailable in certain earlier years because the question was not included in the ACS that year.  Additionally, data summaries may be [suppressed ](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/data-suppression.html) by the census bureau.
