  About\n\n> The Environmental Justice Index uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau,
  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration,
  and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to rank the cumulative impacts
  of environmental injustice on health for every census tract. ... The EJI ranks each
  tract on 36 environmental, social, and health factors and groups them into three
  overarching modules and ten different domains.\n\n\nThe ATSDR's [Environmental Justice
  Index (EJI)](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/eji/index.html) was most recently
  released in 2022, but utilizes data from several older sources.\nNote that although
  the EJI data has a `year` of 2022 in the CoDEC data package, fields in the EJI are
  from different sources that are each actually older. \nFind the full documentation
  of the EJI in PDF form here: https://eji.cdc.gov/Documents/Data/2022/EJI_2022_Data_Dictionary_508.pdf\n\n##
  Data\n\n- Data download from https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/eji/eji-data-download.html
  as a geodatabase\n- Data fields representing \"estimates\" (i.e., not \"percentile\"
  or \"summed ranks\") selected if not avilable elsewhere (e.g., not American Community
  Survey estimates)\n- Field names were renamed to be longer and more descriptive\n-
  Although this is the 2022 release, 2010 vintage census tract geographies and identifers
  are used in the EJI data"
