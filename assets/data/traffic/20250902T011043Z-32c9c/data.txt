  # Average Annual Vehicle-Meters Driven

  ## About

  AADT stands for **A**verage **A**nual **D**aily **T**raffic.
  Aggregated at the census tract-level, AADT is measured in vehicle-meter counts (`aadtm`) and grouped by class (`passenger`, `trucks_buses`, `tractor_trailer`).

  Data is downloaded from the 2020 Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) geodatabase hosted by ESRI using the {[appc](https://github.com/geomarker-io/appc)} package for R.
  For more details about the HPMS, see:

  ## Data

  Only roads with `F_SYSTEM` classification of 1 ("interstate") or 2 ("principal arterial - other freeways and expressways") are used.
  Passenger vehicles (FHWA 1-3) are calculated as the total minus FHWA class 4-7 (single unit) and 8-13 (combo).

  For each 2020 census tract geography, sum the class-specific AADT for all intersecting roads, weighted by their intersecting lengths.
