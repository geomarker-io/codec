## Metadata

Metadata is information *about* data, but does not contain the data itself. For example, a CSV file cannot tell R (or other software) anything about itself including:

- general information like a name, title, description, license, or related URL
- how missing values are denoted
- column names, titles, types, formats, and constraints
- specific CSV "dialect" characteristics required to read it (e.g. delimiter, encoding, quoting)

CODEC utilizes a specific set of standards to store community-level data in an effort to make them more interoperable and reusable.

## Frictionless Standards

[Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/) standards are a set of [patterns](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for describing data, including datasets, files, and tables. These metadata are contained in a specific file (separate from the data file), usually written in JSON or YAML, that describes something specific to each Frictionless Standard.

The CODEC metadata specifications are based on the [Tabular Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) (often written as 'tabular-data-resource' and abbreviated throughout the package as `tdr`). A tabular-data-resource is made up of three Frictionless Standards:

1. [Data Resource](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/): describes an *exact* tabular file providing a path to the file and details like name, title, description, and others
2. [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/): describes a tabular file by providing its dimension, field data types, relations, and constraints
3. [CSV dialect](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/): describes the various dialects of CSV files, including terminator strings, quoting rules, escape rules, etc.

A tabular-data-resource consists of (1) a *single* table of data in a CSV file and (2) its metadata, represented as a hierarchical list in a specific format.  On disk, this metadata is stored as a YAML file and in R, it is stored in the attributes of a data.frame (or tibble).
^[This is a good place to note that although not used here, the [Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/) & [Tabular Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) are similar to the Data Resource and Tabular Data Resource, except for that they describe a *collection* of tabular files.]

## CODEC Metadata Specifications

> *Language:* The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, and “MAY” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Version

CODEC specifications are versioned according to the {CODECtools} package, so this vignette describes version `r packageVersion("CODECtools")`.  To see older versions of the specification, install an older version of {CODECtools}.

### Tabular-Data-Resource Metadata

A **descriptor** (or ["metadata property"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-resource/#metadata-properties)) is a named value used to describe the data resource. The value of most *descriptors* are a single character string (e.g., `name = "my_data_set"`, `path = "my_data_set.csv"`).

**schema** (or ["table schema"](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/)) is a special *descriptor* that stores information about the **fields** (or columns) within a tabular-data-resource. *schema* includes a list of *descriptors* for each *field* as well as the value used to denote missingness and which *fields* are primary or foreign keys.

A tabular-data-resource (with all possible *descriptors*, *schema*, and *fields*) is hierarchically organized and can be represented in the attributes of an R tibble *or* in YAML.

A CODEC tabular-data-resource MUST contain `name` and `path` descriptors. All other descriptors, schema, and fields MAY be present, but MUST be one of:

#### descriptor

- `name`: machine-friendly name of dataset; must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)
- `path`: path to the data CSV file *relative to the `tabular-data-resource.yaml` file*
- `title`: human-friendly name of dataset
- `description`: any additional notes about the data
- `url`: link to repository with code and description about how the data was harmonized to census tract geographies
- `license`:
- `schema`: a list object containing the following

#### schema

- `missingValues`: denotes which string values should be treated as missing; default: `NA` or empty string (``)
- `primaryKey`: a field or set of fields that uniquely identifies each row in
the table 
- `foreignKey`: a field or set of fields that connect to a separate table
- `fields`: a list object, one for each column, containing the following

#### fields

- `name`: machine-friendly name of field/column; must be identical to name of column in data CSV file
- `title`: human-friendly name of field/column
- `description`: any additional notes about the field/column
- `type`: [Frictionless type](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#types-and-formats) of the field/column (e.g., string, number, boolean)
- `constraints`: [Frictionless constraints](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#constraints), including `enum`, an array of possible values or factor levels

Valid names for descriptors, schema, and metadata can be found within CODECtools in R by using:

```{r}
CODECtools::codec_names()
```
